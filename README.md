## üìö About Uninformed Search Algorithms

Uninformed search algorithms (also called blind search algorithms) explore a problem space without any additional information about the goal's location. They systematically traverse the search space to find a solution but do not use heuristics or domain-specific knowledge.

### Implemented algorithms:

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
  Explores as far as possible along one branch before backtracking. It's memory-efficient but may not find the optimal solution.

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
  Explores all the nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the next. It guarantees the shortest path in terms of steps when step costs are equal.

These algorithms are commonly used in:
- Maze solving
- Puzzle solving
- Simple games
- Decision tree exploration
